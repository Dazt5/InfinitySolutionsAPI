# InfinitySolutions API

**Infinity Solutions** is a web application to connect clients and corporations through a web platform that allows them to present their complaints about a service to document and resolve them quickly and efficiently 

The main idea is to install this system within a corporation, but being a degree project I decided not to depend on a fictitious data from a corporation, that is why itÂ´s open to different companies.
